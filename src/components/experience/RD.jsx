                <h4 className='list-text-w'>While working for MBI Project Managment I was tasked with developing a fully automated Inventory managment system. This system included a fully integrated IT, and hardware system. I designed and created senssors to tracker inventory qunatities of a variety of different stock items across the factoy. These sensors were then integrated with a MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express.js, React, Node.js) framework to allow for continual remote inventory tracking.</h4>
